Review my Supabase project's database, focusing on all tables mentioned in the performance warnings (such as outfit_items, order_items, avatar_measurements, orders, favorites, avatars, saved_outfits, profiles):

For all Row Level Security (RLS) policies, replace auth.<function>() and current_setting() calls with their recommended form:

Use (select auth.<function>()) instead of directly calling auth.<function>() in RLS policies, as per performance best practices (see Supabase docs).

This avoids unnecessary re-evaluation for every row and boosts query performance.

For any table (especially profiles) with multiple permissive policies for the same role-action (e.g., multiple insert/select/update policies), consolidate them by merging logic into a single, efficient policy per action and role to minimize redundant checks.

After implementing, ensure:

There are no remaining warnings about RLS policy evaluation or multiple permissive policies.

The app functions securely and efficiently, supporting all expected permissions and behaviors.

Return all revised SQL policy statements or migration scripts and a short summary of changes made.
