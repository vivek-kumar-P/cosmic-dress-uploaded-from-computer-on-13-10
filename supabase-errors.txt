Review my Supabase project and resolve the following security errors for all referenced tables:

Multiple tables (categories, colors, product_images, product_models, product_tag_relations, product_tags, product_variants, products, sizes) show RLS (Row Level Security) policies exist but RLS is not enabled.

Several tables are public but RLS is fully disabled.

For each table listed:

Enable RLS (Row Level Security) to enforce security.

Ensure existing RLS policies are properly activated and applied.

Confirm policies restrict access correctly so only authorized users can view or modify sensitive data.

If the policy is “Anyone can view”, leave read access public, but still enable RLS for fine-grained control over edits or sensitive operations.

Test and verify that data is inaccessible to unauthorized or anonymous requests except where public access is explicitly allowed.

Return clear SQL migration scripts or Supabase CLI commands for each table, plus short deployment instructions.
